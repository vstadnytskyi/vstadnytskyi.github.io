I have been actively working on development of various python libraries. The packages can be divide into major two catagories: data analysis and device interface. A lot of data analysis is done on a fly and tailored to be executed while data is collecting.

## Python Libraries

### Circular Buffer Numpy

A NumPy Python implementation of a circular(ring) buffer based on NumPy array structure. It is very fast and well tested on fast data acquisition Data acquisition Units like DI-4108 by Dataq where data was collected at 20kHz. [GitHub](http://stadnytskyi.com/circular_buffer_numpy/)
