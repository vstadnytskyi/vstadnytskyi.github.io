While working on my PhD degree at Purdue University, I have developed and built several optical instruments and modified many others to perform exotic experiments.

## Shot-noise limited time-resolved circular dichroism pump-probe spectrometer
The work was published in Review of Scientific Instruments [link](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5009468)

## Modification of Ti:Sa oscillator to measure Circular Dichroism at Cryogenic Temperatures
The work was published as a part of Doctor of Philosophy Thesis at Purdue University [see Chapter 5.2](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dissertations/AAI10288324/)
