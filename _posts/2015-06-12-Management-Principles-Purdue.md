The 21st century is a century of collaboration and collegiality. It is important to work in a team, big or small. Purdue University and Krannert School of Management offer this amazing program for all students from all branches of science that helps you to be better with Management, Finances, Law, Accounting, etc. A very nice two-weeks course on Principles of Management.

I am proud I was selected to participate in the course, and I have learned a lot.
